Telegram Reminder Bot - Progress Documentation
Project Overview

This Telegram bot allows users to set reminders, send suggestions to the developer, and ask about security. The bot uses natural language processing (NLP) to interpret reminder dates from user input and has a user-friendly interface.
Current Status
Completed Features

    Bot Initialization
        The bot is initialized using the python-telegram-bot library v21.6
        Handlers are set up for various commands and button responses.

    Command Handling
        Implemented a custom command handler NeoCommandHandler to interpret commands prefixed with "neo".
        The bot responds to the /start command with a personalized greeting and options for user interaction.

    User Interaction
        Users can choose options such as "Set Reminder", "Send suggestion to developer", and "Ask about security".
        Each button leads to specific responses defined in separate handler functions.

    Random Greeting Implementation
        The bot provides greetings in various languages, which are randomly selected for each user interaction.

    Basic Button Functionality
        Integrated ReplyKeyboardMarkup for creating interactive buttons for user choices.

Code Structure

    Main Script: Initializes the bot and sets up handlers.
    Custom Classes: Contains the NeoCommandHandler class and the list of greetings.
    Commands Module: Handles the logic for user commands and button responses.

Logging and Error Handling

    Integrated logging to monitor bot activities and any errors that occur during execution.

Next Steps

0. Stop the natural telegram /start command button and change it into neo 
 
1. Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Date Extraction

    Goal: Enable the bot to extract reminder dates from natural language input without requiring a specific format.
    Action Items:
        Research and integrate an NLP library such as spaCy or dateparser.
        Implement a function to parse user messages for dates.

2. Implement Encryption for Security Questions

    Goal: Ensure user security by encrypting sensitive information related to security questions.
    Action Items:
        Research encryption libraries such as cryptography.
        Create methods to encrypt and decrypt user responses securely.

3. Save Reminder Dates in PostgreSQL Database

    Goal: Persist reminder data to ensure that it is retrievable even if the bot shuts down.
    Action Items:
        Set up a PostgreSQL database.
        Use psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy to handle database connections and queries.
        Create tables for storing reminders.

4. Ensure Bot Resilience

    Goal: Design the bot to recover from unexpected shutdowns and maintain a seamless user experience.
    Action Items:
        Implement logic to fetch stored reminders from the database upon bot restart.
        Handle exceptions gracefully to avoid crashes.

5. Enable Login for Data Persistence

Conclusion

This README serves as a progress documentation for the Telegram Reminder Bot project. 
The core functionalities have been implemented, and further enhancements are planned to improve user interaction, security, and data management. 
As I continue to develop these features, I will document my process and update this file accordingly.
